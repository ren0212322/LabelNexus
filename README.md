# 🍌 MemeStory  
**Built on Story Protocol**  
*Contract: `0x548709a2e4ff648378Ed485a02E4BB2f4378EBA3`*

Turn your memes into programmable IP that pays you.  
AI-generated → auto-uploaded to Pinata → on-chain IP → auto-royalties → remix-to-earn.

---

## ⚡ One-liner  
Create a killer meme in 5 seconds → we pin it to IPFS (Pinata) → register it as an IP Asset → earn every time it’s remixed or shared.  
No lawyers. No middle-men. Just jokes that compound.

## 💸 Monetisation Streams

1. **Viral Remix Royalties**  
   5 % default fee → if your meme spawns 1 000 remises you still earn.

2. **Commercial License Marketplace** (coming)  
   Sell ad-licenses to brands who want to use your meme in campaigns.

3. **IP-Token Vaults** (coming)  
   Stake your IP-ID → borrow stablecoins against future royalty cash-flow.

4. **Airdrops**  
   Early creators (now!) will receive retroactive $STORY & $MEME rewards at TGE.

---

## 🎮 How it Works (30 s flow)

1. Connect wallet (RainbowKit)  
2. Type prompt → “coping cat that bought the top”  
3. AI → meme appears → edit text / place banana sticker  
4. Hit “Mint IP” → media auto-uploaded to Pinata → IP-ID minted to your wallet  
5. Share anywhere → every remix = $MEME in your dashboard
